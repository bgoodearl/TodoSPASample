# Microsoft.Identity.Web

[Microsoft Identity Web on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/tree/master/Microsoft.Identity.Web)

At the time of this writing (c. late June 2019) Microsoft.Identity.Web is not (yet?) available as a NuGet package.
Pull the [source from GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2),
build the library locally and copy it to a folder named `_Binaries` that is a sibling of the directory containing the solution for this sample.
