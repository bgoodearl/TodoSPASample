# Initial Setup

Copy the files `authconfig-dev-local.ts` and `authconfig-prod.ts` from alt-auth to
`...\TodoSPA\ClientApp\src\app-alt\shared\auth`
and set the values in those files from values in Azure Active Directory Application Registrations,
following the instructions in the root readme.md file in this solution.
